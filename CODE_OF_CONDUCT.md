# *Code Of Conduct*

---
Just like any other technical community, Scrapy-puppeteer-service team and community is made up
of many people from all over the world. We want to join them into one huge community of *Scrapy-puppeteer-service*.

As there are many diverse people with different points of view, we decided to write rules for contributing,
issue declaring and discussion. We hope everybody would follow them and enjoy spending time within the community!

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by Scrapy-puppeteer-service project and to all members
of its community.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by
emailing us.

* Be friendly and patient.
* Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.
This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration
status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, age, size, family status, political belief, religion,
and mental and physical ability.
* Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others.
Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account
when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in
someone else's primary language.
* Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior or
bad manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to
turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or
threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Scrapy-puppeteer-service community should be respectful when dealing
with other members as well as with people outside the community.
* Be careful in the words that you choose. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves
professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary
behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
  1. Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  2. Discriminatory jokes and language.
  3. Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  4. Personal insults.
  5. Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  6. Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
* When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and
Scrapy-puppeteer-service is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.
Remember that we’re different. The strength of Scrapy-puppeteer-service comes from its varied community, people from a
wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why
someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming
each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.
